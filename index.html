    <p>Greek yogurt has deep roots in Greek culinary tradition, dating back thousands of years. Known in Greece as straggisto, 
       it was made by straining regular yogurt to create a rich, creamy, and thick consistency. This technique not only improved 
       the texture but also preserved the yogurt longer‚Äîideal for the hot Mediterranean climate.

       In ancient Greece, yogurt was a staple food, valued for its nourishment and digestibility. It was often served with honey and 
       nuts, a tradition still enjoyed today. Greek farmers and shepherds relied on it for energy and sustenance.

       As modern health trends embraced high-protein and probiotic-rich foods, Greek yogurt became a global sensation. Despite its 
       popularity worldwide, true Greek yogurt remains a proud symbol of Greek heritage and is still crafted traditionally in villages 
       across the country.
